Book Review of 「Age of Entanglement」2020313853 황채연           For me, ‘quantum mechanics’ seemed like something far-far away, something that had no relation with my life, so I would never get to understand it. The photo of Einstein, the one that was sticking out his tongue, has been really familiar with me since I was just a little kid. However, I did not know exactly why he was so universally famous- until this semester.       This book was recommended from ‘quanta in everyday life’ class. My review of the book is very relevant to the class, so I would like to explain a bit about this class. Honestly, I was not expecting to join this class because I did not plan to take any science class this semester. However, after failing in signing up for some classes in my wish list, this class caught my eyes. I thought that the term‘quanta’ was cool because it seemed somewhat mysterious but smart at the same time. With a little hesitation, I clicked the ‘sign up’ button of the class.      Its really embarrassing to say, but I did not even know that quantum mechanics belonged in physics. So it may have been obvious that I was terrified with terms like ‘Black body radiation’, ‘Max Planck’ in the first week’s lecture. The professor suggested this book, ‘The Age of Entanglement’ for further understanding of the lecture, so I bought it right away. I was hoping that the book would help me catch up with this class.      Unfortunately the book turned out to be too professional for social-science university student. This book describes quantum concepts by relating with historical events and scientists. This means that the book is readable for only those who knew some quantum concepts, or some historical issues in quantum physics, or at least some scientists who devoted their life for quantum. I was definitely below those specification. So I watched videos of ‘quantum’-including those for kids-on the internet and also carefully played the lectures again. Then I could feel a formation of cluster of quantum concepts in my brain.            With this new cluster of quantum concepts, I opened the book for the second time. Now I could understand the flow of the book. For instance, the book introduced the discussion of the nature of light; whether it was wave or particle. Before, I could not follow the discussion between Einstein and Max Planck, because I did not know what “Planck’s constant” or ‘light diffraction’ was. However, after learning ‘wave-particle duality’ and ‘ultra violet catastrophe’, I felt like I was in the middle of the discussion, in the middle of the Einstein’s lecture of the book. Also, it was interesting to imagine the probable discussions of the physicists in the real world. In class, we learned about the ‘EPR(Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) paradox’. There, I just focused only on what the problem was, and the solution of the paradox. To be specific, I learned the content of the EPR paradox, then the ‘entanglement of quantum’ and the fact that Bell brought an end to this paradox by finding the counterexample of the hidden variable. Since I have only learned the conclusions of these geniuses, I had always thought that scientists themselves had firmly believed that they were born to find out the those solutions. However, throughout reading the probable situations and dialogues of those scientists, I realized that they were also humans; very smart, full of curiosity, but humans just like us.            Through this process, I realized that the loosely connected cluster of quantum concepts turned into a tree of quantum in my brain. This was a fresh experience for me, because it showed me a new aspect of what ‘knowledge’ is. I have always thought 'learning' as a linear process, stacking blocks of theories in given order. However, I realized that not every study and knowledge worked that way. Sometimes you have to make blocks by yourself and build it in your way.
