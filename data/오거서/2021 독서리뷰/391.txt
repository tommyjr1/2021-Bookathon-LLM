Before reading this book, I was afraid of reading physics book because I have never learned physics during my high school period. However, contrary to my expectation, Heisenberg unfolds the text by using dialogue that he did, so this was easy to read though I can not understand all conversations about physics. Also, I was surprised that he did not think only about science, and I can change my prejudice toward physicians by this reading. When I come up with physicians, I always thought they are enthusiastic only to discover new physics theories or have interests in the physics area, but the content is saying that he started to concern the component that consists the world because of Plato's Timiaos philosophy. That's interesting to me in that people can combine physics and philosophy and study them.In this book, I did not understand a lot of conversation, especially about physics. Among them, I did not understand the definition of quantum. In Heisenberg's saying, Quantum is not subject. It is hard to define, but if we define quantum, it is just a component of the observation situation. When I heard this, I felt confusing in that quantum is the smallest thing that consists of something, but it is not a component of the real thing. This part makes me feel that physics is really hard to understand. Also, I felt that the physicians who study quantum mechanics also felt that this binary definition is confusing. They must understand the direction that quantum mechanics pursue more than ordinary people, but primarily this is out of our common sense. After learning the lecture, 'Quanta in Everyday Life', I can not understand what they are saying but, positively I can know which person claimed which. It is poor development when seeing in terms of the physics major, but to me who do not know the basics of physics, it is a jump.
