I read this book because I need to submit a book review for 'Energy in Everyday Life' class. I learned some energy related to chemistry in this class , so I thought that this book is also related to those kind of things. However, this book is about 'positive energy'. Even though I didn't learn 'positive energy' in 'Energy in Everyday Life' class, I think that 'positive energy' is the most suitable for the class name 'Energy in Everyday Life'. This is because 'positive energy' gives me most energy and it is the most important energy for my life.  I am sure that 'positive energy' is the most important energy for my life after I read the story of the book main character George. He is changing positively and working well by following 10 rules for happy life. Some people may think that George's story is just ideal thing and our lives are different from book. I have been originally positive before I read this book. I have experienced power of 'positive energy'. The energy can really help us to achieve things. Then, I also think that the first rule of 10 rules for happy life is very important. This is because it can be considered a matter of course. It is very natural fact, but a lot of people forget this fact.  I strongly recommend negative people to read this book and think things positively. It can change our lives. In addition, I think this book is really helpful for office workers or leaders because George is also office worker and team leader. Actually, there are companies that recommend their workers to read this book. I really appreciate that I can know this book by 'Energy in Everyday Life' class. I will read this book again later because I want to establish a good company in future.
