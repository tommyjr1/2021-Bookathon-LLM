Min Guk Kong (2019-315-262)Humans have created vast resources from technological advances, resulting with no mammal being able to compete with the intellects of humankind. How so? Though multiple pivotal points stamp as the “great leap forward” for man, such were only possible because of the use of energy. According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, there are two types of energies. The first is derived by strength, “the ability to be physically and mentally active”. In contrast, the second utilization of energy is power, “Power from something such as electricity or oil, which can do work, such as providing light and heat.” Both types of energies have become the cause for human success. If it were not for energy of strength, then people would have gone extinct; like our ancestral cousin, the Homo erectus that “Turns out… died out because they were lazy and apathetic.” And the energy of power has catalyzed humanity in our utility of natural resources such as with coal and oil, hence leading us to the modern civilization we live today. In this essay, I will be focusing on how Daniel Yergin, author of The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World (The Quest) discusses the significance of how humans facilitate energy as both strength and power.           The Quest, having divided into six sections, briefly begins its first section, “The New world of oil,” with how oil has led to a geopolitical shift amongst countries. The author exemplifies this with the rise and fall of the USSR, during the Cold War. The Soviet Union discovers the cardinal power plant of oil; however, due to the lack of this resource, the prideful USSR had only one choice but to make amends with Iraq. This created lots of tension around the world because not only was the Soviet Union one of the superpowers of the Cold War, but their finding of oil was presumed to be used for mass destruction. As their discovery of oil could develop a destructive nuclear bomb. Furthermore, with the realization that oil was the “new” source of power to produce products, countries began dive into the oil game. According to the book, it states that oil consumption is currently still a critical source of energy that is assumed to increase from 20-40% in the next twenty years.           The second section hones on the “security of supply” as it is known that energy has become a tool that defines a marital status. Yergin continuously emphasizes the correlation between power and politics, claiming that poor regulation around energy exploitation can harm the infrastructures of society with terrorist attacks and hegemony. Thus, to avoid the instability of society and politics, the author suggests that policies are applied to energy utility. Rules that would restrain nations from developing destructive weapons.           The third, fourth, and fifth sections are all tied with the use of natural resources, whether that be electricity, carbon, and “new” energies, and how they affect us today. For example, the author states that electricity is a vital source for living today. Yet, its use requires oil and carbon emissions, which leads to climate change, and at least 80% of fossil fuels to lighten the world. Therefore, diminishing our natural resources at a rapid speed. Though the world seems hopeless, Yergin reinsures us that the findings of “new” energies, both renewable and efficient energies such as solar and wind power, are in development.           The last section of The Quest, “The Road to the Future,” portrays human society entering a civilization that revolves around resources that are “healthy” in the use of renewable resources beneficial to the environment. Yergin offers examples such as modern day cars fueled by natural gasses to avoid harmful carbon emissions. The section also presents how people must be steadfast with energy utility by applying policies that all countries should abide by to avoid calamitous situations, as depicted in the first section with the USSR and the world.            In conclusion, the use of energy of power is inevitable because without its existence, modern society would collapse. Thus, people must recognize that for society to continuously develop in both economics and life itself. The use of energy must be regulated by policies that apply to nations worldwide. However, if regulations are not placed then instability will come knocking on our doors as sirens scream for “danger.” The society we may know then may become a world of dystopia.
