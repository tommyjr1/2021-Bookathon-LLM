To be honest, I did not know who is the writer of the Physics and Beyond, Encounters and Conversations until last week. Werner Heisenberg is the writer of the book. This name came really familiar to me since couple reasons. First of all, I heard his name myriadly in the class. It is impossible to forget his name. Secondly, which takes the most of a part, I currently watching the American drama named Breaking Bad. In the story, the high school chemistry teacher manufactures and sells the drugs for the money; he need a lot of money for the family before he die by the cancer. However, to cover who he is, he used his nickname as ‘Heisenberg’. For this reasons, I was wonder how this book will be. As I read, I found three interesting things about Heisenberg that is very far from my original thoughts: his life style, reason he became a scientist, and the way he linked other concepts with quantum mechanics.           First of all, by looking his life style, I could find the reason how Heisenberg could be succeeded. I was quite surprised by Heisenberg’s position. At the beginning of the book, Heisenberg had a conversation with his friends while they walk about the picture in the textbook. Person like me never had a question to the things in the textbook; I just d. After he enrolled the university, he made surgery with the professor to talk. While he grew up, he always wanted to seek the truth and tried to find the answer. Furthermore, after he met famous physicists, he could solve some of the questions. His life style is quite different from my life style. When I read textbook, I just put my effort to memorize; I never wonder about natural phenomena. People who have similar lifestyle as Heisenberg would succeed in one’s life in any kind of part. Furthermore, it made me to do self-reflection. I lived passive life which is less productive. In this way, I could not find my life’s enlightenment. From now on, I deduced to live as active person just like Heisenberg and finish my journey.           Secondly, I was quite surprised by his characteristic. I thought Heisenberg decided to go to college since he was manic of quantum mechanics. However, it was not the reason. As a great friend of classic music, Heisenberg once thought to go to college of music. I knew that he was good at playing the piano. There are several reasons he did not go to college of music. First the reason is that he did not think that he could succeed in music. Secondly, the biggest reason is that he did not think that music was not a promising field. He thought that music had vision in couple centuries before, but not anymore. I imagined Heisenberg as a person who had a deep passion on science and had the sense of duty to solve unsolved problems in the world. He was realistic person then I thought. At this moment, I found out that person who got a Nobel Prize is not that different from the most of the normal person. His characteristic was very different than what I had.Last, but not least, I did not think that scientist link science think with other concepts. In the story, Heisenberg and his acquaintances not only talked about scientific methods, but also philosophy, ethics, politics, and more social science. Those conversations were not just low-key ones; they had very deep and serious conversations. I thought science had a low connection with other subjects. Nowadays, science takes the most important part of the world and others supports it. However, Heisenberg thought that if the science disregards the social problems, it is not a pure thing. The image I had for scientist changed a lot at this moment. Moreover, I started to respect Heisenberg. This kind of person would succeed in any kind of field.           To sum up, by reading this book, I learned numerous things of Heisenberg. This person is quite far from the classical scientist. He had a passion, humane characteristic, and receptive position. After I had finished reading, I became a big fan of him. Heisenberg’s works seem more immense, and I could understand how he had done those works. I hope people like him would exceed next to me so I could be under impetus from that one.
