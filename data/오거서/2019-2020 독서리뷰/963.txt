The book you wish your parents had read is a book about  why having relationships with children are hard and how people have relationships with young children, the way to have good connections with them. Moreover, reviewing of one's own childhood. 
 
Family is the smallest society included in the current social form, and the most influential relationships are between parents and children. So why do we need a happy and comfortable home? 
 This book provide some details on how to improve home life and live in a happier building. 

 
The effort parents put to understand themselves and the nature of how they themselves were raised is important, because by this way, they can understand why they treat their kids in a certain way. Parents kind of resemble their parents as well.
 
Talking to children and maintaining resilience should be considered wisely before trying to fix children's behaviors. Parents and guides need to accept mistakes and support children in positive ways. As the society grow and mature, children also grow too. The perspectives of children are different as well. 
 
How were you raised as children in your life? 
When I was at primary to high school, I was not encouraged to see things from a child's point of view - in the same way teachers are thinking that children's thoughts are irrational and unacceptable. 
 
The concept of good and bad motion was described as "convenient" or "inconvenient", which is far less critical.
 
As a student who was curious about how the attitude of parents could trigger or falter a child's growth made me  reflect on my own childhood.
