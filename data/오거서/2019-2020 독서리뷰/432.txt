Europe, a leading country in renewable energy, seeks to move away from its fossil fuel-oriented energy structure and move toward its final goal of hydrogen economy by strengthening its carbon tax and carbon emission rights system to expand renewable power generation.Major energy companies such as BP and SHELL in the U.K. have expanded their renewable and eco-friendly investments to achieve the 'Zero-emission' goal of their energy structures by 2050. The dictionary definition of "carbon net emission zero" is that the arithmetic sum of carbon emissions and carbon absorption is "0, but the usual meaning is to reduce the use of fossil fuels and to increase the use of renewable energy innovatively.BP published the BP Sustainability Report 2019 and the BP Annual Report 2019. According to the report, the company aims to become a "Net Zero" company by 2050, helping the world reach carbon neutrality, which in fact calls for global cooperation to achieve the "Paris Climate Agreement."The "Paris Climate Change Agreement" is an international agreement signed in 2015 that replaced the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which was scheduled to expire in 2020, and includes a subsequent response to climate change, also called the "New Climate System" and the "Post-2020 System." It was stipulated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so that the global average temperature does not rise by more than 2°C compared to before industrialization, and 1.5°C was specified as a goal of further strengthening efforts. Unlike the previous Kyoto Protocol, the characteristics of the convention are based on the voluntary goals of the participating countries, the Nationally Detected Contribution (NDC). The NDC includes areas such as greenhouse gas reduction and funding and technology, which are only obligated to submit by participating countries and are not legally binding. The U.S. was scheduled to withdraw in November 20 after former President Trump notified him of his withdrawal from the agreement in November 1919, but it was confirmed that he would rejoin the agreement due to Biden's election. The successful implementation of the Paris climate agreement is difficult without cooperation from the U.S., which accounts for 15 percent of the world's greenhouse gases and is the second-largest global carbon emitter.Biden, who is promoting eco-friendly policies, has been elected, and the core of Biden's major policy pledges on climate change response is to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on the first day of his term, 2) complete the system to achieve "Net zero-emission" in 2050, and 3) plans to introduce a carbon tax and carbon national tax bill by 2025. It emphasized solar and wind power among renewable energy sources and planned an aggressive investment of $2 trillion (about 2,200 trillion won) in eco-friendly energy structure reform. As the supply of renewable energy is becoming the main source of energy due to the continuous reduction in the unit price of power generation, it was a time when we could expect a shift from fossil fuel base to renewable energy. Also green energy generation come faster than I think.
