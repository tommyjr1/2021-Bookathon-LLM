The Quest (Daniel Yergin, 2011) Review:

           The
book ‘The Quest’ is considered for many a modern classic in the field of
energy, geopolitics, and socioeconomics, and I can clearly see why it was
recommended strongly as a must read for this class as it encompasses a huge
variety of subject that are highly interconnected through their consequences on
each other. For example, the writer talks in the prologue of the book about
Middle Eastern geopolitics in the Saddam era and its direct effects on the world’s
prices of oil in the period after the Gulf War of 1990, showing how the current
global economy is not a matter of merely pragmatic economic transaction between
countries that are eager to work together in a diplomatic atmosphere, but a
more complex manifestation of power, stability and personal interests that
hinder the ability of a stable oil consumption and distribution regime that benefits
all sides equally.

The book, majorly, shies away from giving a
definitive ‘right’ answer to any controversial question regarding energy consumption,
political ideology, or even moral evaluation which makes it a good read for an
objective, historical, and factual recapitulation of the modern energy and
political landscape, but at the same time it is sometimes meddled by personal
biased opinions that every so often confuse the reader about the validity of
those claims as facts, because there is no indication that it is only the
writers own opinion and perspective. For example, when the writer talks about
the ‘Nissan’ Situation and how Carlos Ghosn has resurrected the company from bankruptcy.
It is filled to the brim with implicit praise and amazement on the story and achievement
of the company with even personal quotes from Ghosn himself, who is being
accused for ‘fraudulent activities’, which makes it as a smack in the middle advertisement
for Nissan and its new ‘Leaf’ automobile. 

What made this book a very enjoyable read
for the most part is its excellent presentation of different topics that
somehow, one way or another are definitely interconnected, which allows the
reader to establish a solid understanding of how really intricate the energy/state-industrial
complex and the effect of historical and regional events such as the Iraqi
invasion, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the communist modernization of
China on public discourse and decision till this day regarding issues
concerning energy consumption, trade, and even military and political
conflicts.

The book is divided by the author into 6
parts that are extensive in their own right and Segway into each other by
adding a historical context that enables readers to draw the dots by themselves
on certain issues such as the relation between national security, political inclusiveness,
public opinion and energy economics, consumption and availability.

The first part
is titled ‘The New World of Oil’ which is a fitting title for a historical
revisionist outlook on the modern political and economic conflicts of the 20th
and 21st century that greatly shaped the world and lifestyle that we
are living today. Yergin starts off with an intensive history lesson on the
Soviet Union’s collapse, past affairs and succession starting from the presidency
of Gorbachev and its economic effects on opening up the country to a capitalist
economic atmosphere which lead to the establishment and privatization of many
oil and gas companies and the future prospect on Russia as the country the world’s
largest gas reserve. This chapter was not only dedicated to Russia and its
neighboring countries and the intra-conflict between them for a regional
domination of energy supply, it also explored the other major events in history
such as different merges between energy companies, the Venezuelan economic
growth and collapse and finally the rise of China as a monolithic regional
power in East Asia. This part also demonstrates how all of those historical events
affect the reader and their life regarding oil prices, power consumption and
the availability of their lifestyle.

The second part
of the book focuses mainly on the energy resources in use in the world
throughout the 20th and 21str century and their trends of use as
focus on specific energy supplies are targeted due to availability and national
policies. The writer in this part is mainly trying to answer the question of ‘Are
we running out of conventional fossil fuel energy resources, and if so what are
the geo-political and economic implications of such events on the world as a
whole?’ Yergin also explores natural and liquid gas as a well as unconventional
fossil fuels and their trends of use in the USA, China and the Middle East as
well as political consequences of different threats to the energy supply and
demand such as terrorism, cyber-attacks, and conflict of interests between
governments. 

Part III is a
comprehensive and detailed rundown on the modern electrical revolution,
providing the necessary background and history about the subject which was
intermitted with a section about nuclear energy. This part felt like a rehashed
history lesson that was not particularly interesting to me as a reader because
the narrative was stretched out and more detailed than ever, especially talking
about California more than anywhere else in the world in that section, which
drew a sense of tediousness and redundant specificity. Although that was true,
the writer does a pretty good job on displaying the role of government and
resource management in sustaining a stable electricity supply.

Parts IV, V and
VI are mainly interested in the future, the way we look at energy from an environmental,
economic and social point of view, and how advances in energy affect the
lifestyle of humans all around the world and the effect of renewable energy on
the politics of countries.

As a summary for
this review, the book have been added to my favorite lists as it was extremely exhaustive
and overarching and historically comprehensive, it was a great read to
understand what actually goes beyond the flip of the switch that we do at home and
the ramifications of an extra hour on the TV or the computer on the geopolitics
and economies of countries and their attitude toward energy resources and
energy-related conflicts.
