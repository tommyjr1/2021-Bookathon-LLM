AI judge, AI lawyer!What does this artificial intelligence mean? Is it really possible?The "judgment predictor," called an artificial intelligence judge, is a symbol of predictable artificial intelligence that finds patterns through data analysis and moves toward prediction. Predictions are the nature of natural intelligence and the real face of artificial intelligence. Fredrik introduced the principles of artificial intelligence judges for the first time in Korea, explaining in detail the underlying predictors and meta-artificial intelligence that symbolizes the future. Fredicus is a word that symbolizes both natural and mechanical predictive intelligence.The author of the book, Lim Young-ik, is an incumbent lawyer and founder of the Anticon Meta Research Institute, which studies legal artificial intelligence. The author developed the first artificial intelligence legal system in Korea and is a pioneer of legal artificial intelligence who has won the 2016 World Legal Artificial Intelligence Competition (Tokyo) and the 2017 World Legal Artificial Intelligence Competition (London). Based on his experience in the research and development of actual legal artificial intelligence, he talks about deep learning, predictive intelligence, artificial intelligence judge, and meta intelligence with a sense of urgency.
