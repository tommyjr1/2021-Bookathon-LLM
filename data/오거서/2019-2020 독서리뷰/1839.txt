After reading this story, I had felt the importance of wisdom. Hershel went to a synagogue where there were goblins living. Every Hanukkah, people lit their candles, but the problem was that the goblins would not allow them to lit the candles there. As a matter of fact, Hershel went to challenge them. First, there was a little goblin, Hershel frightened it by crushing eggs. Secondly, another goblin was trapped in a pickle bowl because of it's greed. The third goblin was fooled by playing games and gold. Lastly, the King of the Goblins were the most difficult one. Although Hershel was afriad, he relied on the Maker of Heaven, he acted courageously. He underlooked upon the goblin and made it lit the candles by itself. When the 8th candle was lit, it was the last night. When the goblin found out what it had done, it was already late. The peace of the town had come. Through the story, I learnt how Hershel dealt with the goblins. The goblins are troubles and difficulties we face. Some are afriad, some are frightened. But I learnt that wisdom is the key for problem solving. Hershel was humorous to the goblins. The goblins, on the other hand, could only see things before them. When I face difficulty, I should always ask the Maker of the Earth first.
