"The Quest" Book ReviewEunhae Song 2018315319Energy is a crucial resource everyone makes use of every single day. No matter the difference in lifestyle, culture, and other personal characteristics each individual is privileged to have, everyone has access to a source of energy on a daily basis. By reading this book, it helped me notice that the concept of energy (along the production and materials involved) is so crucial to our lives, yet we are so used and dependent on it that it is hardly ever thought about its true value.Looking back into the history of energy, humans have found their own ways to get such a distinguished resource. In the earliest of times, past civilizations heavily relied on the energy coming from living animals, such as horses, mules, and even humans. This energy source is known as muscle-powered energy and there were no non-living materials used that acted as the main source of energy. However, as society advanced in technology, a new period began: The Industrial Revolution. This crucial stage in history was able to arrive, mainly because coal became the main source of energy and people became heavily dependent on it. The 18th century seemed to continue with its high use of coal until the 19th century when solar power started to develop. In addition to the wind-power energy source that also made its appearance in a similar period, the creation of different kinds of energy sources created a drastic change in the use of energy in society. Strong political powers were able to get their hands much quickly and abundantly to such sources of energy. In the book, “The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World” written by Daniel Yergin, the author is a true intellectual that focused on the concept of energy production with a scientific approach and a political approach.The book is divided into 6 sections, each informing about the different events in relation to the current energy sources in society. In the first part of the book, the author focuses on the political approach and goes over the Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, which created an issue with the oil industry for the other countries in demand for such resource. In addition, the rise of the political power of China is mentioned as well. Behind the mentioning of these political historic events, Yergin indicated that as technological advancement continues, the demand for energy (along with the core materials needed to produce such resources) will steadily increase. As a result, the demand for energy consumption was said to increase up to 40 percent for the upcoming two decades. From the information, he gathered as a professional in this area, Yergin stated the way the decreasing amount of energy supply has created drastic changes to society, in terms of political and economic development.Following the next sections, the author mentioned how the appearance of electricity becomes a crucial step for opening doors to the modern world. As electricity became a key energy source, society enters the stage known as ‘The Electric Age”. Electricity is mostly produced from coal and fossil fuels make up around 80 percent of the world’s energy. This leads to the concern of climate change, an issue that is yet to be solved. Yergin mentioned that the severeness of climate change is not spoken seriously as time goes on and argued that some studies indicate that climate change can bring severe, drastic effects on our environment. The author focused on looking at the issue with a scientific approach; however, he also looked at the political approach and argued that the government’s current policies are not helping as much to enforce a stronger energy security policy that can possibly prevent the consequences of climate change. In addition, he mentioned that carbon taxing and putting up more money to strict research for better production of energy is necessary to avoid possibly inevitable future problems. Moving on, Yergin stated that present-day technology cannot create affordable energy. He mentioned that solar and wind energy can be candidates of unlimited energy; however, solar and wind energy is not fully reliable, because the amount of wind and sun is a force that mankind cannot control.           After reading this book, I had one main thought about how current society gets hands on energy sources: political forces are willing to keep increasing the amount of energy sources for further technological development; however, alternative ways of getting energy sources should matter even more for the upcoming future generations. As the author mentioned, climate change can bring more severe effects than what we are currently expecting to happen. For this reason, our society should enforce strong energy security and lead more alternative ways to prevent consequences that can affect us later in the future.           I recommend this book to not only soon-to-be-professionals of energy resources and similar fields. As citizens of a society, we should be aware of our surrounding environment, especially how the energy we have access to is being provided to us. Also, it is crucial to understand how the political powers are structuring energy security to prevent further consequences to the environment we live in.
