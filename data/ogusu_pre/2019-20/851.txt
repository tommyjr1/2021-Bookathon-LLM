The Quest ReviewThebook The Quest’ is considered for many a modern classic in the field ofenergy, geopolitics, and socioeconomics, and I can clearly see why it wasrecommended strongly as a must read for this class as it encompasses a hugevariety of subject that are highly interconnected through their consequences oneach other. For example, the writer talks in the prologue of the book aboutMiddle Eastern geopolitics in the Saddam era and its direct effects on the world’sprices of oil in the period after the Gulf War of 1990, showing how the currentglobal economy is not a matter of merely pragmatic economic transaction betweencountries that are eager to work together in a diplomatic atmosphere, but amore complex manifestation of power, stability and personal interests thathinder the ability of a stable oil consumption and distribution regime that benefitsall sides equally.The book, majorly, shies away from giving adefinitive right’ answer to any controversial question regarding energy consumption,political ideology, or even moral evaluation which makes it a good read for anobjective, historical, and factual recapitulation of the modern energy andpolitical landscape, but at the same time it is sometimes meddled by personalbiased opinions that every so often confuse the reader about the validity ofthose claims as facts, because there is no indication that it is only thewriters own opinion and perspective. For example, when the writer talks aboutthe Nissan’ Situation and how Carlos Ghosn has resurrected the company from bankruptcy.It is filled to the brim with implicit praise and amazement on the story and achievementof the company with even personal quotes from Ghosn himself, who is beingaccused for fraudulent activities’, which makes it as a smack in the middle advertisementfor Nissan and its new Leaf’ automobile.What made this book a very enjoyable readfor the most part is its excellent presentation of different topics thatsomehow, one way or another are definitely interconnected, which allows thereader to establish a solid understanding of how really intricate the energystateindustrialcomplex and the effect of historical and regional events such as the Iraqiinvasion, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the communist modernization ofChina on public discourse and decision till this day regarding issuesconcerning energy consumption, trade, and even military and politicalconflicts.The book is divided by the author into 6parts that are extensive in their own right and Segway into each other byadding a historical context that enables readers to draw the dots by themselveson certain issues such as the relation between national security, political inclusiveness,public opinion and energy economics, consumption and availability.The first partis titled The New World of Oil’ which is a fitting title for a historicalrevisionist outlook on the modern political and economic conflicts of the 20thand 21st century that greatly shaped the world and lifestyle that weare living today. Yergin starts off with an intensive history lesson on theSoviet Union’s collapse, past affairs and succession starting from the presidencyof Gorbachev and its economic effects on opening up the country to a capitalisteconomic atmosphere which lead to the establishment and privatization of manyoil and gas companies and the future prospect on Russia as the country the world’slargest gas reserve. This chapter was not only dedicated to Russia and itsneighboring countries and the intraconflict between them for a regionaldomination of energy supply, it also explored the other major events in historysuch as different merges between energy companies, the Venezuelan economicgrowth and collapse and finally the rise of China as a monolithic regionalpower in East Asia. This part also demonstrates how all of those historical eventsaffect the reader and their life regarding oil prices, power consumption andthe availability of their lifestyle.The second partof the book focuses mainly on the energy resources in use in the worldthroughout the 20th and 21str century and their trends of use asfocus on specific energy supplies are targeted due to availability and nationalpolicies. The writer in this part is mainly trying to answer the question of Arewe running out of conventional fossil fuel energy resources, and if so what arethe geopolitical and economic implications of such events on the world as awhole?’ Yergin also explores natural and liquid gas as a well as unconventionalfossil fuels and their trends of use in the USA, China and the Middle East aswell as political consequences of different threats to the energy supply anddemand such as terrorism, cyberattacks, and conflict of interests betweengovernments.Part III is acomprehensive and detailed rundown on the modern electrical revolution,providing the necessary background and history about the subject which wasintermitted with a section about nuclear energy. This part felt like a rehashedhistory lesson that was not particularly interesting to me as a reader becausethe narrative was stretched out and more detailed than ever, especially talkingabout California more than anywhere else in the world in that section, whichdrew a sense of tediousness and redundant specificity. Although that was true,the writer does a pretty good job on displaying the role of government andresource management in sustaining a stable electricity supply.Parts IV, V andVI are mainly interested in the future, the way we look at energy from an environmental,economic and social point of view, and how advances in energy affect thelifestyle of humans all around the world and the effect of renewable energy onthe politics of countries.As a summary forthis review, the book have been added to my favorite lists as it was extremely exhaustiveand overarching and historically comprehensive, it was a great read tounderstand what actually goes beyond the flip of the switch that we do at home andthe ramifications of an extra hour on the TV or the computer on the geopoliticsand economies of countries and their attitude toward energy resources andenergyrelated conflicts.
