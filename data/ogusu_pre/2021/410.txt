To young Werner HeisenbergHello, Werner. I’m Lee byeongju. I read your book, Der Teil und das Ganze.’ Thanks to you, I can feel a sense of closeness with you, Niels Bohr, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, and many other people not because of their principles, but because of your stories. Especially an episode that Dirac made a plan to see all geysers in the Old Faithful makes me laugh. Have you ever heard of MBTI? I’m sure Dirac’s MBTI is J.By the way, your conviction surprised me. I think it is really difficult to break the existing system and create something new. But you did it! In other words, you tried to make your way in the world. In the process, you tasted a lot of sweetness such as finding sources of the matrix mechanics’ and devising the uncertainty principle.’ Those things would have been your driving force, wouldn’t they?I have an idea that many people should have dreams like you, also I should. In reality, however, lots of young people seem not to have their dream. Perhaps I have a fantasy dream since I’m too young to understand them. I may already be a young Kkondae. But I don’t want to give up my dream. Because I would like to make my life dazzling and tell my life story to my children and grandchildren proudly someday. Anyway, every person lives life just once, Right?So I’ll do my best for myself like you. Even if I don’t know if you’ve actually done your best during your lifetime, at least you got a name in your field. I respect you. Although I don’t have a nice companion like Niels Bohr, and I’m not a genius as much as enough to create the matrix mechanics, I’ll draw my life as I want to be. So if we meet someday, give me a compliment for my doing well.I think I told you everything I wanted to say. If you see this letter, please reply. You know my address, right? Take care! 2021.05.26.From Lee byeongju.
