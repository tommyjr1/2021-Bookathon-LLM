The author of The Quest presents future insights and events centered on energy sources in six chapters .The amount of electricity used by a person will increase over time.The world powers are using various means to secure energy at this moment in time.Even if this book does not suggest, we know that national disputes are not limited to territory or the trade economy, but news surrounding energy is always a major issue.Conflicts and disputes over energy will continue throughout the past and throughout the future.If you look at the history of conflict in each country in detail from an energy perspective, you can take a new look at the history of conflict.We know for the most part that the United States launched an air strike under the pretext of using Iraqs WMD.Behind the scenes was then Iraqi President Husseins declaration of receiving oil in euros, not dollars, and the U.S. accepted it as a challenge to the key currency, which led to the war.An oil currency that threatens even the U.S. dollar, a superpower, will be an example of the value of energy sources.History has proven that the energy we use easily and waste is actually surrounded by political interests to secure it, and that we are willing to fight for it.In other words, there will be an unparalleled class between countries that have secured energy and those that do not, which will affect not only energy but also all economic activities and diplomatic issues throughout society.Korea is a country that does not produce a drop of oil, and the total amount of domestic energy imports is close to 40 of the total domestic income. According to the Korea International Trade Association, since 1997, when monthly statistics began to be compiled, the dependence on energy imports exceeded 95 percent by 2015, and has remained in the 93 percent range since then.In addition, Korea is an energydissolving country, and the energy source unit is the last among OECD countries. Nuclear power is considered to be very economical and clean energy. Nevertheless, the Korean government is implementing a policy that reduces the dependence on nuclear power generation, which is a concern.We can see that securing energy sources is a very important thing that has a huge impact on the security of our country. However, there is an invisible but unambiguous threat. The author argues that overheating competition for energy sources is destroying the environment of our planet, and we need to find a way to prevent it.Waste and byproducts from energy sources, including carbon dioxide, are causing global warming and raising the temperature of the Arctic. Since the 1870s, more than half of the worlds coral reefs have disappeared due to global warming and agricultural and industrial wastewater.Every country is aware of this and through the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, we are trying to prevent reckless carbon emissions and protect the global environment in which we live.According to the second basic energy plan for the 20132035 period announced by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Korea aims to reduce electricity demand by 15 percent and greenhouse gas by 20 percent. Therefore, new and renewable energy is to increase dependence on new and renewable energy, which is 8 energy, solar, solar, bioenergy, wind, hydro, geothermal, marine energy and waste, i.e., fuel cells, hydrogen energy, coal and petroleum liquefaction and gasification.However, new and renewable energy is still less competitive in terms of improving utilization efficiency and creating profitability than other energy sources.The utilization efficiency of solar energy in Korea is only 15 and wind power is 20, and nuclear power requires about a tenth of Yeouidos area to build a power generation facility of 1 million kW, while solar power needs 10 times and wind power 50 times.The author suggests methods such as molds that decompose toxic wastes in the industry, and techniques that decompose agricultural wastes into ethanol.It is not inefficient and economical right now, but it is selfevident that it is a necessary investment for our future generations to nip clean air and national disasters in the bud. Its not enough yet, but I think the direction we have to go is to tell us the destructive history of energy and the collapsing global environment.In the energy competitiveness, energy security, and environmental pollution between countries, we must make the right choice, and we must make efforts to do so.
